
- Players must place their desired bet before cards are dealt. The dealer deals two cards to 
the player and two cards for themself-one of them unknown to both participants. Each card 
retains its respective value. The only exception to this is: face cards all have a value of 
10 and aces, depending on the player's choice or the hand dealt, can have a value of either 
1 or 11. 

- Since this is a numeric game, all the suits will be nullified and replaced by numeric 
values. For number cards, the values are the same as original. The initial cards dealt 
will be displayed in the form of a sum for the player and a single number for the dealer.
Cards dealt after that will be added on to the hand.

- Players must choose between hitting or standing. If players are content with their hand, the 
dealer may turn over their second card. The dealer must then deal cards until their own hand 
reaches a value of 17 or more.

- If the player's hand sum is higher than that of the dealer's and lower than 21, they win money 
equivalent to their bet-if not, they bust. If the dealer busts, the player wins. Blackjack is 
achieved only when either dealer or player reach exactly 21.
